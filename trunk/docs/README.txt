To build and run this game simply download the repository and run the java files with eclipse. The entire repository needs to be imported into the eclipse workspace for eclipse to run it.
If you wanted to run this game in an editor outside of eclipse you would simply just need to create an ant file to compile and build all the files, then have it run the game file for the game to start. In order for this to work you would need to update the file paths for the resources before compiling making sure the compiler knows exactly where it needs to look.
There are four text files which are needed to play the game they are in the main part of the repository. These files can be modified but for the best experience only let the game modify them. 
All the code for the game is in the src folder. The main folder has the Game and GamePanel java files. Game makes the window and makes a GamePanel. GamePanel makes a GameStateManger and draws it. The GameState folder has the GameStateManager and all the GameState java files. Each GameState is what is currently getting input and displaying output. GameStateManager controls which GameState is currently running. The TileMap folder had the Background, Tile and TileMap java. The Background java uses a file from the Backgrounds folder in the resources folder and draws it. Tile loads a type and an image from the Tilesets folder in the Resources folder. TileMap loads a map from the Maps folder in the resources folder and draws it using the graphics each Tile loads loads from the Tileset. The Entity folder holds a folder called Enemies, and java classes of Enemy, Hud, Player, Animation, Explosion, and MapObject. The Enemies folder has a java file called Chickens which is for the Chicken enemy type this is where to put other types of enemy types. The Enemy class is the parent of the different types of enemy. The Hud class is used to draw the current health and experience to the screen. The Player class is all of the player stats, it’s image, and what it looks like. Animation is used to decide which sprite needs to be used at each frame. Explosion is used to draw the sprite for enemy’s death. MapObject is used to check collisions. The Audio folder has the AudioPlayer class which is used anytime any sound is player.
All of the graphics and the map for the game are in the resources folder.
